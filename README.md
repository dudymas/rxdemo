# Presenting Reactive eXtensions for Javascript

This is a quick editable demo of how to get started with RxJs.

Feel free to fork this and alter it to show off in your own languages.

# Using bower/grunt to start presenting

This presentation uses reveal.js and grunt to kick off building and running.

#TODO

- Finish presentation
- Add interactive demos (BONUS: use Rx to power the demo REPL itself)
- Add depth to the full demo (noises, animations, rainbows)
